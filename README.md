## Rules for branches and pull requests

This is the standard workflow our team follows.
Please use these rulles and follow these steps to avoid merge conflicts and keep the repository clean.

``` bash
# 1. 🧹 Always start by updating the main branch. Switch to main and pull the latest updates:

git checkout main

git pull

# 2. 🌿 Create your feature branch from the updated main. Name your branch according to your task (feature/footer as example)

git checkout -b "your branch name"

## This will also switch you to the new branch.

# 3. 🛠 Do your work inside your feature branch. Add and commit your changes, push to your remote branch in GitHub.

# 4. 🔄 Before creating a Pull Request, update your branch (align with main):
    # 4.1 Switch to main:
    git checkout main

    # 4.2 Pull updates:
    git pull

    # 4.3 Go back to your feature branch:
    git checkout "your branch name"

    # 4.4 Merge the updated main into your branch:
    git merge origin/main

    # 4.5 If there are conflicts: resolve them carefully + make sure you do not break main’s current logic

    # 4.6 Commit the merge:
    git add .
    git commit -m "merge: update branch from main"

    # 4.7 Push your updated branch:
    git push

# 5. Create a Pull Request in VsCode or GitHub
